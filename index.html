                    All your life, you lived in dullness and settled for the most comfortable option. You work a
                    nine-to-five
                    corporate job making enough to get by a year, living in a one-bedroom studio with no furniture other
                    than a
                    futon. You’ve decided it’s time for a change, and you go outside for a hike around the very mundane,
                    stale,
                    and boring town of Mungville, where everyone lives the same boring life, seeking only comfort in
                    what is
                    attainable. As you are walking, you end up witnessing a glowing dark portal with an odd heat coming
                    off
                    of
                    its exterior. What do you do?
