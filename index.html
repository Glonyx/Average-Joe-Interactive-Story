        All your life, you lived in dullness and settled for the most comfortable option. You work a nine-to-five corporate job making enough to get by a year, living in a one-bedroom studio with no furniture other than a futon.

As you are walking, you end up witnessing a glowing dark portal with an odd heat coming off of its exterior. What do you do?
